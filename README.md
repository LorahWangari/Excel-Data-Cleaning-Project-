# Excel Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project showcases my skills in cleaning and organizing raw data using Microsoft Excel. I used a sample dataset to simulate a real-world cleaning task and followed industry-standard steps for preparing data for analysis.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Key Tasks Performed
- Removed duplicate entries
- Standardized formatting (date columns, capitalization)
- Split and combined columns using Excel formulas
- Handled missing data appropriately
- Applied data validation to improve consistency

## Before vs After
- Original data was cluttered, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze.
- After cleaning, the dataset was structured and ready for deeper analysis or visualization.

## What I Learned
- Attention to detail is critical when preparing data
- Efficient use of formulas and filters can save time and improve accuracy
- Data validation and conditional formatting are powerful tools for error detection

## Next Steps
I plan to build a dashboard using this cleaned data to demonstrate analysis and visualization.
